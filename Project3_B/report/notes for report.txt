assumptions

If the file is not present in the working directory, or not readable, it makes an empty decoding tree (with only the dummy node at the root). So any encoding or decoding will not be valid.

valid data for tree with no blank nodes in the middle
'.' is dot
dash can be any char with ascii value > '.' ('_' works '~' works '-' doesn't work)

trying to decode an invalid code returns error string instead of decoded string
